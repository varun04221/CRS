This is the final bonus project submission for the course CSE101 Introduction to Programming.

The problem statement was to design any application/program using what we have learned in the course.


The motive of my program is to detect the current emotions of the user through 3 ways:-
  1.Directly asking the user.
  2.Through a questionnare.
  3.Through Emotion detection by capturing the Image of the user and using the deepface python library.

and based on the emotions we would suggest the user songs.

In order to run/use the program first run the "make config" command to make sure you have required python libraries installed in your system.

If your already have required libraries installed on your system run the command "make run" to run the program.
